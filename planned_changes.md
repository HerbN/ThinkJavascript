This document describes some of the changes I am planning for the Think Javascript.  Please comment and spark discussion.

1) Design around node.js.

2) Include installation instructions in Chapter 1.  Also include a "Getting Started with Javascript in Your Browser" section.

3) I'm sure we will go well beyond 3.
